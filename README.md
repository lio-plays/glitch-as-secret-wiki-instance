# glitch-as-secret-wiki-instance

## Notes to myself

i want to use this as a tempate for fresh projects.
it imports a package of mine for a basic server, [lio-plays/glitch-as-secret-wiki](https://github.com/lio-plays/glitch-as-secret-wiki).

Remember to set something in .env/SECRET, which is used as password and cookie-secret, or it will fail.
